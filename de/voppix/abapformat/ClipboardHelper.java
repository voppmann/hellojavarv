/** ClipboardHelper has two static methods for retrieving a string
 * from the system clipboard and for putting a string in the system
 * clipboard
 *
 * @Method get
 * @Method put
 * 
 * The problem in an X-Windows environment is, that the clipboard
 * contents is lost when the owner program exits (because the
 * clipboard itself just stores a pointer to a memory area of the
 * contents owning program), see
 * https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ClipboardPersistence
 *
 * This can be circumvented by leaving the program running (e.g.
 * `System.in.read()');
 * Maybe the contents can also be retained by some clipboard manager
 * as mentioned on: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clipboard_manager
 *
 * (as of today (2013-11-27):
 * - parcellite does not work for me
 * - clipit (fork of parcellite) does not work for me
 * - glipper sees what we put in the clipboard if (and only if) we
 *   afterwards ask it for the new contents, if not -- it doesn't even
 *   show up in history. However, the contents is still cleared from
 *   the current clipboard as this program exits -- the contents can
 *   only be retrieved from the clipboard manager's history, quite
 *   strange. Not good.
 * )
